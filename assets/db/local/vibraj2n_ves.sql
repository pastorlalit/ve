(3, '8-tips-to-crack-the-ibps-exam', '8 Tips to Crack The IBPS Exam', '<p>Under the administration of the Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS), a Mumbai based human resource agency, the entire employment program of the Indian banking sector is conducted. IBPS conducts employee recruitment exams for nationalized banks, Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), central and other financial institutions, cooperative banks, insurance companies, academic institutes, state-owned companies, and private corporates. The pattern of IBPS exams differs from each other slightly. However, the basic syllabus and structure of all IBPS exams are the same - beginning with the Common Written Exam (CWE) exam, followed by group discussion and personal interview respectively. In the case of, IBPS Clerk &amp; PO exam there are two rounds - Preliminary and Mains exam where those qualifying the Prelims are only eligible for mains exam and then interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is stating 8 simple tips that you can consider when in a plan to apply for any of the IBPS exams. Note, all IBPS exam preparation requires ample preparation and dedication to be cracked with a good score.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Interview round of IBPS exam-&nbsp;</strong>In the interview round of the IBPS exam, you will be questioned by a panel of 3-4 professionals who will start from basic introductory questions, move to bank-specific questions and general knowledge arena. The total time range is less than half an hour per IBPS candidate and confidence is the chief key to crack the IBPS interview round.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Location of IBPS interview -</strong>&nbsp;Once you are confirmed an interview session for IBPS exam, make sure you gather enough information about the test center and reach there on time, on the exam day. Usually, IBPS interviews are held in their various departments across 200 locations in India.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Solving IBPS Reasoning section-</strong>&nbsp;The IBPS reasoning section aims to judge the rational and thinking capability of the test taker. The reasoning section contains 35 marks. However, to solve the IBPS reasoning section do not rely alone on your intelligence. Each question is backed by formulas or strategic approach. If you can pick the right option to solve an IBPS reasoning question, you are sure to get the final correct answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Negative marking in IBPS exam-</strong>&nbsp;For every wrong answer, 0.25 mark is deducted from your total score. Therefore, do not answer in the IBPS exam just to complete the paper. Answer or attempt questions that you are sure about. Multiple wrong answers can hamper your score. Hence, it&#39;s better to only answer questions in the IBPS exam that you are confident about.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Solve previous year IBPS question papers-</strong>&nbsp;Alike any other entrance exam, the suggestion of solving old question papers extends to the IBPS exam as well. Many remain confused for changing syllabus patterns, whether to solve old papers. Despite syllabus change, experts recommend solving IBPS old papers to master the strategic approach of solving IBPS paper in time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Special area to cover for IBPS exam-</strong>&nbsp;While the entire exam procedure to the syllabus of the IBPS exam might be like any other entrance exam, the only distinguishing point is - the IBPS exam requires focusing on the Indian economy and banking sector. Every IBPS aspirant should have a clear idea about Indian banks, their work system, history, and related stories in order to acquire a job in this field.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Computer knowledge</strong>&nbsp;As Indian banks are still on the process of going completely electronic/online, every IBPS candidate now needs to have clear computer knowledge. For the computer paper, you should definitely cover the following topics during IBPS exam preparation - Basic of Computers, Operating System Functions, Basic internet knowledge and protocols, Computer Basic Questions, Network basics (LAN &amp; WAN), Generations of the computer, Input &amp; Output Device, Shortcuts &amp; Basic of MS office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>IBPS Learning Strategy</strong>&nbsp;As the IBPS exam includes different kinds of subjects, some students plan to learn each subject one by one. This strategy is time-consuming and may make you forget GK when you are preparing maths. The remedy here is, to pay equal focus to all subjects you plan to cover. Solving some maths in the morning, learning GK in the evening and ending with the computer is a good day during your IBPS exam preparation stage.</p>', '', 'Vibrant Career', '2020-03-29'),

Education provides prudent leaders and along with it, media can intellectually propagate knowledge and information. The media should comment, appreciate and criticize the steps taken by the government. Media feed the public mind to make them have an unbiased perception which affects society at large. So media, in any form, helps extend public opinion which develops a robust relationship between the government and common mass. It familiarises students, the future of any country, with government policies and its principles. It also performs as an institute as it inculcates awareness among the public and educated them in another way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Media coverage that lacks research and facts can create chaos and turmoil though it is meant to mitigate both. Media should be impartial in reporting and should not be biased towards or against a particular government, opinion, community, principal, etc. It is expected to form a positive public opinion through intertwining the news with the collection of facts and researches.</p>', './assets/uploads/728887e3dd666e93e1421eb14e064c7f.jpg', 'Vibrant Career', '2020-03-30'),
